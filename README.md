## 🌎 Problem We're Solvingg

> **60% of people in LATAM don't save.**  
> There’s a lack of culture, tools, and incentives to encourage long-term saving habits.
> Only 0,06% of all the world use DeFi 

Vaquita addresses this by making DeFi fun,, social, and financially rewarding

## 🕹️ How Vaquita Works?

- **Dynamic Reward Pool:**  
  Users who stay committed to their savings goals earn not only interest but also a share of penalties from those who withdraw early..
  For example: if 100 users deposit $100 each and 20 withdraw early, their generated interest is redistributed among the 80 who stay, boosting their APY from ~5% to ~8%. 

- **Game Theory Incentives:**  
  Rewards are redistributed to long-term savers,  encouraging consistency and reducing the temptation of early withdrawals.

- **Gamified Experience:**  
  Users interact with visual elements (like cow avatars representing savings goals) and track their progress in a fun, engaging way.
